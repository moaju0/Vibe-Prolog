### Using as a Library

```python
from vibeprolog import PrologInterpreter

prolog = PrologInterpreter()
prolog.consult_string("""
    parent(tom, bob).
    parent(tom, liz).
    grandparent(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z).
""")

results = prolog.query("grandparent(tom, Who)")
for result in results:
    print(f"Tom's grandchild: {result['Who']}")

result = prolog.query_once("parent(tom, X)")
if result:
    print(f"Tom's child: {result['X']}")

if prolog.has_solution("parent(tom, bob)"):
    print("Tom is bob's parent")
```

### Loading from Files

```python
prolog = PrologInterpreter()
prolog.consult("my_rules.pl")
results = prolog.query("my_query(X)")
```

## Architecture Overview

The interpreter consists of four main components:

1. **Parser** (`vibeprolog/parser.py`) - Uses Lark to parse Prolog syntax with full
    operator precedence, multi-base numeric literals (including base-qualified
    numbers like `16'ff`), quoted atoms/strings, escapes, and ISO character code
    forms (except for a handful of noted edge cases).
2. **Unification** (`vibeprolog/unification.py`) - Robinson-style unification with
   occurs-check by default so cyclic structures are prevented.
3. **Engine** (`vibeprolog/engine.py`) - Backtracking search with built-in
   predicates, cut semantics, dynamic predicate assertion/retraction, first-argument
   indexing for efficient clause lookup, and the dispatcher that resolves
   functor/arity to handlers.
4. **Interpreter** (`vibeprolog/interpreter.py`) - Public API for loading and
   querying programs, plus helpers for consulting strings/files and capturing
   output streams.

## First-Argument Indexing

The engine implements first-argument indexing to optimize clause lookup performance for large knowledge bases. Instead of scanning all clauses linearly during goal resolution, the engine maintains an index mapping first argument patterns to relevant clauses, enabling O(1) lookups for many common query patterns.

### How It Works

The index maps first argument patterns to clause lists:

- **Ground atoms**: Direct lookup by atom value (`person(alice, X)` → key = `alice`)
- **Ground numbers**: Direct lookup by number value (`age(25, X)` → key = `25`)
- **Empty list**: Direct lookup for `[]` (`list([], X)` → key = `[]`)
- **Compound terms**: Lookup by functor of first argument (`tree(node(X), Y)` → key = `node/?`)
- **Variables**: No indexing - falls back to scanning all clauses (`person(X, Y)`)

### Data Structure

_first_arg_index = {
    # Values are lists of integer indices into the engine's main clause list
    # (i.e., clause indices, not clause objects)
    ('person', 2, 'atom', 'alice'): [0, 5],
    ('person', 2, 'atom', 'bob'): [8],
    ('age', 2, 'number', 25): [12],
    # ...
}

_variable_first_arg_clauses = {
    # Stores indices for clauses with a variable as the first argument
    # (i.e., clause indices into the engine's main clause list)
    ('person', 2): [15, 21],
    # ...
}

### Performance Impact

- **Indexed queries** (ground first arg): O(1) lookup instead of O(n) scan
- **Unindexed queries** (variable first arg): O(n) scan (same as before)
- **Dynamic operations**: `asserta/assertz/retract/abolish` maintain index consistency

### Implementation Details

- Index keys are generated by `_make_index_key()` method
- Clauses are indexed during addition via `_index_clause()`
- Retrieval uses `_get_indexed_clauses()` for efficient filtering
- Dynamic database operations update the index automatically

## Built-in Registry

Built-ins live under `vibeprolog/builtins/` and register themselves via
`prolog.builtins.register_builtin`. Each module exposes a static `register`
method so the engine can populate its registry at startup. Handlers use the
signature `(args, subst, engine)` and can yield multiple substitutions for
non-deterministic predicates.

### Adding a New Built-in Predicate

1. **Choose the appropriate module** in `vibeprolog/builtins/`:
   - Arithmetic operations → `arithmetic.py`
   - List operations → `list_ops.py`
   - Type tests → `type_tests.py`
   - Control flow → `control.py`
   - Database → `database.py`
   - I/O → `io.py`
   - Term manipulation → `term_manipulation.py`
   - All-solutions → `all_solutions.py`
   - Exceptions → `exceptions.py`
   - Reflection → `reflection.py`
   - Higher-order → `higher_order.py`

2. **Add a static method** to the module's class:

   ```python
   @staticmethod
   def my_builtin(args: BuiltinArgs, subst: Substitution, engine: EngineContext) -> BuiltinResult:
       """my_builtin/N - Description."""
       # Implementation
   ```

3. **Register in the module's register() method**:

   ```python
   @staticmethod
   def register(registry: BuiltinRegistry, engine_ref=None):
       registry[("my_builtin", N)] = ModuleClass.my_builtin
   ```

4. **Add tests** in `tests/test_*.py`.
5. **Update FEATURES.md** to mark the predicate as implemented.

## Tooling & Tests

- Exercise the system primarily through the Python API (`from vibeprolog import
  PrologInterpreter`) and the pytest suite (800+ tests covering ISO core,
  parser pathologies, and built-in behaviors).
- `PrologInterpreter` exposes `consult/consult_string`, `query`, `query_once`,
  and `has_solution`, plus optional stdout capture so predicates like `write`
  and `format` can be observed while still returning substitutions.
- Built-in predicates are dispatched through the registry in
  `vibeprolog/engine.py`. To add one, register a handler that either yields
  substitutions or returns `None`. Helpers such as `_format_to_string`,
  `_list_to_python` (respects active substitutions), and `_fresh_variable`
  centralize tricky behavior so new built-ins stay consistent.

### Predicate properties and mutability

- `PrologInterpreter.predicate_properties` maps `(functor, arity)` to a set of
  properties (`dynamic`, `multifile`, `discontiguous`, `static`, `built_in`).
- `PrologInterpreter._predicate_sources` tracks which consult call introduced
  each predicate so non-multifile predicates cannot be extended by later files.
- The same structures are shared with `PrologEngine` so runtime database
  operations enforce the recorded properties.

User-defined predicates start as **static**, meaning `asserta/1`, `assertz/1`,
`retract/1`, and `abolish/1` raise `permission_error` unless the predicate was
declared `dynamic/1`. Built-ins are always `static` and `built_in`. Discontiguity
and multifile declarations are validated during consultation to ensure clause
ordering and multi-file composition follow ISO expectations.

## Utility Modules

Shared helpers for the AST live in `vibeprolog/utils/`:

- `term_utils.py`: Formatting, comparison, and sorting helpers for terms.
- `list_utils.py`: Convert between Python and Prolog list forms; match/shape
  lists.
- `variable_utils.py`: Variable collection, copying, and existential stripping.

These modules are imported by `vibeprolog/engine.py` and have focused coverage in
`tests/utils/`.

## DCG (Definite Clause Grammar) Support

DCG rules are syntactic sugar for Prolog clauses that manipulate difference lists.
The `vibeprolog/dcg.py` module handles the expansion of DCG syntax into regular Prolog.

### DCG Expansion Process

1. **Parser**: DCG rules `Head --> Body` are parsed as special clause types
2. **Expansion**: During consultation, DCG clauses are expanded using `DCGExpander`
3. **Storage**: Expanded rules are stored as regular Prolog clauses with difference list arguments

### Expansion Rules

- `Head --> Body` becomes `Head(S0, S) :- ExpandedBody`
- Terminals `[X, Y, Z]` → `S0 = [X, Y, Z | S]`
- Non-terminals `foo` → `foo(S0, S)`
- Sequences `a, b` → threaded difference lists: `a(S0, S1), b(S1, S)`
- Alternatives `(a ; b)` → `a(S0, S) ; b(S0, S)`
- Embedded goals `{Goal}` → `S0 = S, Goal` (no list threading)
- Empty `[]` → `S0 = S`
- Cut `!` → preserved as-is

### Built-in Predicates

- `phrase(RuleSet, List)` ≡ `RuleSet(List, [])`
- `phrase(RuleSet, List, Rest)` ≡ `RuleSet(List, Rest)`

DCG rules are expanded at parse time, not runtime, ensuring efficient execution.

## Recursion Depth Limits

The engine enforces a maximum recursion depth to prevent Python stack overflow and provide clear error messages for infinite recursion.

### Configuration

```python
# Default limit: 500
prolog = PrologInterpreter()

# Custom limit
prolog = PrologInterpreter(max_recursion_depth=1000)
```

### Behavior

- Depth is tracked across all goal resolution
- When depth exceeds `max_depth`, raises `resource_error(recursion_depth_exceeded)`
- Depth counter resets for each top-level query
- Error includes context showing which predicate exceeded limit

### Limitations

- This is a hard limit, not tail-call optimization
- Tail-recursive predicates still consume depth
- For unbounded tail recursion, see issue #141 (TCO implementation)

## Examples

### Family Relationships

```prolog
parent(tom, bob).
parent(bob, ann).

grandparent(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).
```

### List Operations

```prolog
% member/2 is built-in
?- member(2, [1,2,3]).  % True
?- member(X, [a,b,c]).  % X = a ; X = b ; X = c
```

### Logic Puzzles

```prolog
person(alice).
person(bob).

job(alice, doctor).
job(bob, engineer).

% Who has which job?
?- job(Person, doctor).  % Person = alice
```

## Module System

- Each module is represented by a `Module` object stored in `PrologInterpreter.modules`.
- Module declaration uses `:- module(Name, Exports).` and sets the current module context for subsequent clauses during consultation.
- Predicates defined in modules are associated with their defining module; clauses carry a `module` attribute.
- Module-qualified calls use the syntax `Module:Goal` and resolve only against the specified module's predicates (and built-ins).
- Export lists control which predicates are accessible from outside the module; attempting to call a non-exported predicate via `Module:Pred` raises a permission error.
- The default module for non-module code is `user` and its predicates are globally accessible.

## Limitations

This interpreter intentionally focuses on ISO core features. Significant gaps
you should be aware of:

- File/stream I/O predicates (`see/1`, `read/1`, `open/3`, etc.) and character
  I/O helpers are stubbed or missing.
- Directive handling (`dynamic/1`, `multifile/1`, `op/3`, etc.) now wires
  predicate properties and operator table updates, but the parser still applies
  only the built-in operator set when reading source code.
- ISO error term infrastructure (`error(ErrorType, Context)` along with
  `instantiation_error`, `type_error`, etc.) still needs work; most built-ins
  fail silently instead of raising structured errors.
- Character code hex escapes (`0'\\xHH`) are supported alongside other character code forms.
- Base'char'number syntax (e.g., `16'mod'2`) is intentionally not implemented.
  This is an extremely obscure ISO edge case with ambiguous semantics in the
  standard, no real-world usage, and would require significant parser
  restructuring for minimal value.
- No DCG, module system, CLP libraries, or tail-call optimization. Recursion depth is limited to prevent Python stack overflow (default: 500 levels).

## Test Coverage Snapshot

As of 2025-11-23 the pytest suite reports `878 passed, 4 skipped` (out of 882
collected) via `uv run pytest`. The skips are parser stress cases that require
future ISO syntax additions; everything else (unification, type checks,
arithmetic, lists, control flow, meta-predicates) currently passes.
