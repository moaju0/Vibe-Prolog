- ⚠️ `:- op/3` – Define operator (registry + current_op/3; parser still uses built-in operator syntax)
- ❌ `:- char_conversion/2` – Define character conversion

## Syntactic Constructs (ISO 6)

### Terms
- ✅ Atoms (unquoted, quoted)
- ✅ Numbers (integers, floats, scientific notation)
- ✅ Variables
- ✅ Compound terms
- ✅ Lists (proper and improper)
- ✅ Character codes (`0'X`, `0'\n`, etc.)
- ✅ Character codes (`0'\\xHH` hex escapes)

### Operators
- ✅ Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `mod`, `**`)
- ✅ Comparison operators (`=`, `\=`, `=:=`, `=\=`, `<`, `=<`, `>`, `>=`)
- ✅ Control operators (`,`, `;`, `->`, `\+`, `!`)
- ✅ Term comparison operators (`==`, `\==`, `@<`, `@=<`, `@>`, `@>=`)

### Number Literals
- ✅ Decimal integers
- ✅ Binary (`0b`), octal (`0o`), hexadecimal (`0x`)
- ✅ Case-insensitive binary/octal/hex prefixes
- ✅ Scientific notation
- ✅ Leading-dot and trailing-zero floats
- ✅ Floating point
- ✅ Base-qualified numbers (`16'ff`, `2'abcd` - base'digits syntax)
- ❌ Base'char'number syntax (`16'mod'2`) - Intentionally not implemented. This is an extremely obscure ISO edge case with ambiguous semantics in the standard. No real-world usage observed, and implementation would require significant parser restructuring for minimal value.

### Comments
- ✅ Line comments (`%`)
- ✅ Block comments (`/* */`) - fully implemented with nesting support
- ✅ Nested block comments
- ✅ PlDoc comments (`%%`, `/** */`, `/*! */`) - SWI-Prolog style documentation comments with `predicate_documentation/2` built-in for inspection

### Special Syntax
- ✅ Curly braces `{Term}` (sugar for `{}(Term)`)
- ✅ List syntax `[H|T]`, `[Elements]`
- ✅ String syntax (double and single quoted)
- ✅ Operator syntax with proper precedence

## Module System

- ✅ `:- module/2` – Module declaration with export list. Modules are recorded in `PrologInterpreter.modules`.
- ✅ `Module:Goal` – Module-qualified calls are parsed and supported (syntax `Module:Goal`).
- ✅ Export list enforcement for module-qualified calls: non-exported predicates raise a permission error when accessed from outside the module.
- ✅ Predicate scoping: clauses are associated with their defining module (clauses receive a `module` attribute) and module-local predicates are stored under `Module.predicates`.
- ✅ `current_module/1` – Enumerate loaded modules (built-in in `vibeprolog.builtins.reflection`).
- ✅ `module_property/2` – Query module exports and (where available) the source file.
- ✅ Built-ins remain accessible from all modules.
- ⚠️ `use_module/1,2` imports are not implemented in this change (deferred).
- ✅ Module-aware resolution for non-qualified goals inside clause bodies: unqualified goals in clause bodies resolve first to the defining module's predicates, then to user module predicates, preserving export restrictions for other modules.
- ⚠️ Dynamic/multifile interactions across modules are supported minimally and may need further tests and refinement.

## Execution Model
- ✅ Robinson-style unification
- ✅ Occurs check (prevents cyclic terms)
- ✅ Full backtracking search
- ✅ Dynamic clause enumeration
- ✅ Recursion handling
- ✅ Cut operator semantics
- ✅ If-then/else evaluates conditions lazily (only first success) to preserve backtracking
- ✅ Term comparison uses deterministic ordering (variables < numbers < atoms < compounds < lists) for deterministic sort/setof results
- ✅ List conversions honor active substitutions when traversing open list tails (e.g., append/sort/reverse)
- ✅ Python conversions reject improper or partially instantiated lists instead of silently truncating

## Error Handling
- ✅ ISO-style structured error terms (error(ErrorType, Context))
- ✅ Instantiation errors for unbound required arguments
- ✅ Type errors for incorrect argument types
- ✅ Domain errors for values outside valid domains
- ✅ Syntax errors for parse failures
- ✅ Error context with predicate information

## Data Types
- ✅ Atoms
- ✅ Integers (arbitrary precision via Python)
- ✅ Floats
- ✅ Variables
- ✅ Proper lists
- ✅ Improper lists
- ✅ Compound terms
- ✅ Empty list `[]` equivalent to `'[]'`

## High-Priority Gaps and Deviations

### Critical Missing Features
1. **Dynamic Operator Parsing**: `op/3` updates the operator table and current_op/3, but parsing still uses the built-in operator set (custom operators require canonical functor syntax).
2. **Character Conversion**: `char_conversion/2` not implemented.

### Significant Deviations
1. **Character Code Syntax**: Some advanced character code forms not supported.

### Parser Limitations
1. **Hex Character Codes**: `0'\xHH` syntax now supported with optional trailing backslash for compatibility
2. **SWI-Style Dict Syntax**: `tag{a:1}` syntax not supported
3. **Operator Definition**: `:- op/3` updates the table but parser does not apply custom operators (only built-ins parse as operators)
4. **Unary Minus Precedence**: In some cases, unary minus may bind differently than expected (e.g., `-X + Y` parses as `-(X + Y)`)
5. **Base'char'number Syntax**: `Base'char'number` syntax (e.g., `16'mod'2`) intentionally not implemented - extremely obscure ISO feature with ambiguous semantics and no practical use
